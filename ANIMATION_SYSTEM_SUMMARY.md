- **animations.css:** 15KB (uncompressed)
- **Tailwind config:** +2KB (config additions)
- **Total impact:** ~3-4KB gzipped
- **Performance:** Negligible impact on load time

## Testing Recommendations

### Visual Testing
1. Test all entrance animations
2. Verify stagger effects
3. Check hover interactions
4. Test on different screen sizes
5. Verify dark mode animations

### Performance Testing
1. Chrome DevTools Performance tab
2. Record during animations
3. Check for 60fps
4. Monitor CPU usage
5. Test on slower devices

### Accessibility Testing
1. Enable "Reduce Motion" in OS
2. Verify animations are disabled
3. Test keyboard navigation
4. Check focus indicators
5. Verify screen reader compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Animations Not Appearing
1. Check animations.css is imported in index.css
2. Verify Tailwind config syntax is correct
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check for CSS class name typos
5. Verify build process completed successfully

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce number of simultaneous animations
2. Check for layout thrashing
3. Use Chrome DevTools Performance
4. Verify GPU acceleration is enabled
5. Test on target devices

### Conflicts with Existing Styles
1. Check CSS specificity
2. Use browser DevTools to inspect
3. Verify Tailwind classes are being applied
4. Check for conflicting animations
5. Review cascade order

## Future Enhancements

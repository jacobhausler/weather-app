# Fix Plan

This file tracks issues, bugs, and incomplete implementations that need to be addressed, sorted by priority.

## Completed Items

### âœ“ GitHub Actions Build Failures - ESLint Configuration Missing
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing during lint steps for both frontend and backend builds. The ESLint configuration files were missing from the repository, causing the `npm run lint` commands to fail.

**Resolution**:
- Added `.eslintrc.cjs` configuration file to frontend root directory
- Added `.eslintrc.cjs` configuration file to backend `server/` directory
- Both configurations include appropriate TypeScript and React rules
- Lint steps now pass successfully in the build pipeline

**Impact**: CI/CD pipeline can now complete successfully, enabling automated builds and deployments to GitHub Container Registry.

### âœ“ Duplicated Header Elements on Mobile (P0)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Header component was rendering BOTH mobile and desktop layouts simultaneously on mobile devices, resulting in duplicate titles, ZIP inputs, and refresh buttons.

**Resolution**: Fixed responsive layout implementation to ensure only one layout renders per viewport size.

---

### âœ“ API Connection Failure/refresh endpoint (P0)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Frontend could not connect to backend API, causing immediate errors on refresh button and continuous background refresh failures.

**Resolution**: Fixed API connection issues and implemented proper /api/weather/refresh endpoint for manual refresh functionality.

---

### âœ“ Error Banner Overlaps Header (P1)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Error banner used `fixed top-0` positioning while header used `sticky top-0` positioning, causing overlap on mobile viewports.

**Resolution**: Adjusted error banner positioning to appear below header without overlapping.

---

### âœ“ Background Refresh Continues Despite API Failures (P1)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Background refresh timer ran every 60 seconds regardless of API status, creating console spam and network congestion when backend was down.

**Resolution**: Implemented exponential backoff and intelligent retry logic to handle API failures gracefully.

---

### âœ“ Horizontal Forecast Buttons Preferences Not Persisted (P3)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Hourly forecast chart period and data type selections were not being persisted to localStorage.

**Resolution**: Implemented client-side caching of user preferences for hourly forecast chart selections.

---

### âœ“ Unit Conversions Applied to All Components
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Imperial/Metric unit conversion toggle needed to be implemented across all weather data displays.

**Resolution**: Added unit conversion functionality with toggle in footer, applied across all temperature, wind speed, visibility, and other measurements.

---

### âœ“ UV Index Added to CurrentConditions
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Resolution**: UV Index data now displayed in Current Conditions card when available from NWS API.

---

### âœ“ Sunrise/Sunset Times Added to CurrentConditions
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Resolution**: Sunrise and sunset times now displayed in Current Conditions card.

---

### âœ“ Server-Side Background Refresh for Cached ZIPs Implemented
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Resolution**: Backend now maintains 5-minute server-side refresh cycle for configured cached ZIP codes (75454, 75070, 75035), serving cached data immediately while triggering background refresh.

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

*No critical issues pending*

---

## High Priority Issues

*No high priority issues pending*

---

## Medium Priority Issues

### ðŸŸ  P2: Mobile Footer Spacing Insufficient
**Status**: PENDING
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Content cut off on some devices
**Files**: `src/App.tsx:21,98-103`

**Issue**:
- Fixed footer may cover content on smaller screens
- Padding-bottom (pb-20) may be insufficient for all devices

**Fix**:
1. Calculate footer height dynamically
2. Use CSS custom properties for dynamic padding
3. Test on various mobile screen sizes (320px - 428px width)

---

### ðŸŸ  P2: Horizontal Scroll Not Obvious on 7-Day Forecast
**Status**: PENDING
**Severity**: MEDIUM - Users may not realize they can scroll
**Files**: `src/components/SevenDayForecast.tsx:58-60`

**Issue**:
- 7-day forecast requires horizontal scrolling on mobile
- No visual indicator that content is scrollable

**Fix**:
1. Add scroll hint/indicator (fade gradient or arrows)
2. Consider "swipe to scroll" instruction on first use
3. Or implement carousel-style navigation with dots

---

## Low Priority Enhancements

### ðŸŸ¢ P3: React StrictMode Double Rendering
**Status**: PENDING (Development Only)
**Severity**: LOW - Only affects development
**Files**: `src/main.tsx:6-9`

**Note**: This is intentional React behavior in development. No fix needed for production.

## Testing Requirements

Before marking as complete:
1. Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
2. Test with backend server running and not running
3. Test all responsive breakpoints (320px, 375px, 768px, 1024px)
4. Test with slow network (3G throttling)
5. Test error states and recovery
6. Verify Docker deployment works correctly

~~2. **Second**: Fix API connection (P0) - Restores core functionality~~ âœ“ COMPLETED
~~3. **Third**: Fix error banner position (P1) - Improves mobile UX~~ âœ“ COMPLETED
~~4. **Fourth**: Add background refresh throttling (P1) - Reduces errors~~ âœ“ COMPLETED
5. **Next**: Address remaining P2/P3 items as time permits
   - Mobile footer spacing verification
   - Horizontal scroll indicators for 7-Day Forecast

## Success Criteria

Mobile deployment is considered successful when:
- [x] No duplicate UI elements on any screen size
- [x] ZIP code input works and fetches weather data
- [x] Error messages display without breaking layout
- [x] All weather cards render correctly on mobile
- [ ] Footer doesn't cover content (pending verification on all devices)
- [x] Background refresh handles failures gracefully
- [x] App is responsive from 320px to 1920px width

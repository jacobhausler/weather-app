# Fix Plan

This file tracks issues, bugs, and incomplete implementations that need to be addressed, sorted by priority.

## Completed Items

### âœ“ GitHub Actions Build Failures - Unused Opacity Prop in GlassCard (P0)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-10-02)

**Issue**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing during lint step for frontend builds. ESLint error in `src/components/ui/glass-card.tsx:55` - unused `opacity` prop parameter that was declared in the interface and destructured but never used in implementation.

**Root Cause**: The glassmorphism implementation (commits 2221aa0 through 39f55ed) introduced a GlassCard component with an `opacity` prop that was never utilized. Opacity is controlled via CSS variables (--glass-bg-light/dark) in the design system.

**Timeline**:
- Last successful build: 2025-10-02 15:29:50 (commit b98cb90)
- First failure: 2025-10-02 15:52:32 (commit 2221aa0)
- 4 consecutive failed builds
- Fixed: 2025-10-02 16:20:24 (commit c96941d)

**Resolution**: Removed unused `opacity` prop from GlassCardProps interface and component destructuring. This aligns with the "SIMPLICITY IS PARAMOUNT" principle.

**Files Modified**: src/components/ui/glass-card.tsx

**Impact**: CI/CD pipeline restored, automated builds and deployments to GHCR operational.

### âœ“ GitHub Actions Build Failures - ESLint Configuration Missing
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing during lint steps for both frontend and backend builds. The ESLint configuration files were missing from the repository, causing the `npm run lint` commands to fail.

**Resolution**:
- Added `.eslintrc.cjs` configuration file to frontend root directory
- Added `.eslintrc.cjs` configuration file to backend `server/` directory
- Both configurations include appropriate TypeScript and React rules
- Lint steps now pass successfully in the build pipeline

**Impact**: CI/CD pipeline can now complete successfully, enabling automated builds and deployments to GitHub Container Registry.

### âœ“ Duplicated Header Elements on Mobile (P0)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Header component was rendering BOTH mobile and desktop layouts simultaneously on mobile devices, resulting in duplicate titles, ZIP inputs, and refresh buttons.

**Resolution**: Fixed responsive layout implementation to ensure only one layout renders per viewport size.

---

### âœ“ API Connection Failure/refresh endpoint (P0)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Frontend could not connect to backend API, causing immediate errors on refresh button and continuous background refresh failures.

**Resolution**: Fixed API connection issues and implemented proper /api/weather/refresh endpoint for manual refresh functionality.

---

### âœ“ Error Banner Overlaps Header (P1)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Error banner used `fixed top-0` positioning while header used `sticky top-0` positioning, causing overlap on mobile viewports.

**Resolution**: Adjusted error banner positioning to appear below header without overlapping.

---

### âœ“ Background Refresh Continues Despite API Failures (P1)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Background refresh timer ran every 60 seconds regardless of API status, creating console spam and network congestion when backend was down.

**Resolution**: Implemented exponential backoff and intelligent retry logic to handle API failures gracefully.

---

### âœ“ Horizontal Forecast Buttons Preferences Not Persisted (P3)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Hourly forecast chart period and data type selections were not being persisted to localStorage.

**Resolution**: Implemented client-side caching of user preferences for hourly forecast chart selections.

---

### âœ“ Unit Conversions Applied to All Components
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Issue**: Imperial/Metric unit conversion toggle needed to be implemented across all weather data displays.

**Resolution**: Added unit conversion functionality with toggle in footer, applied across all temperature, wind speed, visibility, and other measurements.

---

### âœ“ UV Index Added to CurrentConditions
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Resolution**: UV Index data now displayed in Current Conditions card when available from NWS API.

---

### âœ“ Sunrise/Sunset Times Added to CurrentConditions
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Resolution**: Sunrise and sunset times now displayed in Current Conditions card.

---

### âœ“ Server-Side Background Refresh for Cached ZIPs Implemented
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-09-30)

**Resolution**: Backend now maintains 5-minute server-side refresh cycle for configured cached ZIP codes (75454, 75070, 75035), serving cached data immediately while triggering background refresh.

---

### âœ“ Mobile Footer Spacing Insufficient (P2)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-10-01)

**Issue**: Fixed footer was covering content on smaller screens due to insufficient padding-bottom spacing.

**Resolution**: Implemented CSS custom property-based solution using `--footer-height: 4rem` variable that synchronizes footer height with main container padding-bottom. This ensures content is never covered by the fixed footer on any mobile device size (320px-428px).

**Files Modified**: src/App.tsx, src/index.css

---

### âœ“ Horizontal Scroll Not Obvious on 7-Day Forecast (P2)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-10-01)

**Issue**: 7-day forecast required horizontal scrolling on mobile but had no visual indicator that content is scrollable.

**Resolution**: Added intelligent fade gradient overlay on the right edge that automatically shows/hides based on scroll position and content width. Uses theme-aware gradient (from-card to-transparent) for both light and dark modes. Includes scroll detection with useEffect hook and proper event listener cleanup.

**Files Modified**: src/components/SevenDayForecast.tsx

---

### âœ“ Layout Optimization - Center 7-Day Forecast, Side-by-Side Current/Hourly Cards (P3)
**Status**: RESOLVED (2025-10-02)

**Issue**: Card layout stacked all components vertically. Needed to improve visual hierarchy and space utilization on larger screens.

**Resolution**: Implemented responsive layout improvements:
- 7-day forecast card is now centered with max-width of 4xl (56rem)
- Current Conditions and Hourly Forecast cards display side-by-side on md+ screens (â‰¥768px)
- Both cards compacted: reduced font sizes, spacing, icons, and chart height (300px â†’ 250px)
- All components remain under 300 lines
- Responsive grid uses Tailwind md:grid-cols-2 breakpoint
- Mobile screens continue to stack vertically for optimal readability

**Files Modified**:
- src/App.tsx (lines 82-124) - Added responsive grid layout
- src/components/CurrentConditions.tsx - Compacted spacing and typography
- src/components/HourlyForecast.tsx - Reduced chart height and control spacing

## Implementation Notes

### Complexity Ratings
- ⭐ Easy (1 Star): Simple components, basic logic
- ⭐⭐ Easy-Medium (2 Stars): Multiple API calls, state management
- ⭐⭐⭐ Medium (3 Stars): Complex orchestration, time zones, caching
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Medium-Hard (4 Stars): Real-time data, alerts, advanced features
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hard (5 Stars): Advanced visualizations, time series analysis

### Development Principles (from CLAUDE.md)
- **Simplicity is paramount**: Components < 300 lines
- **Separation of concerns**: Display components separate from data fetching
- **KISS & DRY**: Keep it simple, don't repeat yourself
- **Smart tests**: No mocks, no placeholders
- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1-2**: Foundation (backend + NWS integration) - **CRITICAL**
2. **Phase 3-4**: Core UI (components + cards) - **CRITICAL**
3. **Phase 5-6**: Preferences + refresh logic - **HIGH**
4. **Phase 7**: Testing - **HIGH**
5. **Phase 8**: Deployment - **HIGH**
6. **Phase 9**: Documentation - **MEDIUM**
7. **Phase 10**: Future enhancements - **LOW**
